1. What does the term "Memory Mapped" in "Memory Mapped I/O" mean?
A. The term Memory-mapped I/O refers to the memory locations that I/O devices are mapped to.

2. What is the difference between a byte-sized memory-mapped interface register and a regular byte of RAM?
A. Memory-mapped I/O uses the same address space to address both memory and I/O devices unlike a regular byte of RAM.

3. Why is polling considered to be inefficient?
A. There are numerous elements to be polled in each polling cycle and only a few elements are active and as it is resource 
   intensive and wasteful it is considered to be inefficient

4. How could you organise polling of two or more interfaces?
A. By polling only critical interfaces at a high rate, while polling noncritical interfaces at a normal or slower rate.
   
5. Why would polling be bad for a computer's energy consumption?
A. The responsibility for detecting the I/O opportunity rests with the CPU, and as the
   cpu must allocate more resources to this, it is bad for a computer's energy consumption.
